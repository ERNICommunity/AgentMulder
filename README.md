Welcome to the ERNI Community fork of Agent Mudler! We love DI and we love Agent Mulder, so the news of its untimely death ware saddening to us. Fortunately for us, we managed to organize a few people interested in the project and started preparing our resurrection spells.

It is with great pleasure that i give you **Agent Mulder Revival**.

You can find details on the state of the project in the [wiki](https://github.com/ERNICommunity/AgentMulder/wiki/Status).

We hope to have something for you to download soon. In the meantime, feel free to check out the source, the projects, and the wiki for details on what's to come.

_Please note: we are in the process of sorting the details out with the original author of the extension, the ilustrious @hmemcpy_

Welcome to the ERNI Community fork of Agent Mulder! We love DI and we love Agent Mulder, so the news of its untimely death ware saddening to us. Fortunately for us, we managed to organize a few people interested in the project and started preparing our resurrection spells.

It is with great pleasure that I give you **Agent Mulder Revival**.

The release is officially out! Get it from the [ReSharper Gallery](https://resharper-plugins.jetbrains.com/packages/ERNI.AgentMulder/)

You can find details on the state of the project in the [wiki](https://github.com/ERNICommunity/AgentMulder/wiki/Status).

_Please note: @hmemcpy is the original author, this fork is now, with his blessing, the official maintenance place for the plugin_
